  ## Constraint Taxonomy

We define a small, fixed set of constraint types that capture long-term, non-reversible properties of a character.
These constraints are accumulated across the narrative and later tested against the proposed backstory.

### 1. Belief Constraints

Definition:
Stable worldviews or assumptions inferred from repeated actions or decisions.

Examples:
- Distrusts authority
- Believes loyalty is paramount
- Avoids institutions

Why it is a constraint:
Beliefs shape repeated behavior across time.
A lifelong belief cannot flip repeatedly without explicit narrative justification.

### 2. Trait Constraints

Definition:
Long-term personality characteristics that remain stable across the narrative.

Examples:
- Cowardly
- Loyal
- Impulsive

Why it is a constraint:
Traits influence decision patterns.
A character consistently acting against a claimed trait creates a contradiction.

### 3. Capability Constraints

Definition:
Skills, physical abilities, or knowledge that enable or prevent actions.

Examples:
- Can fight
- Can read
- Is physically weak

Why it is a constraint:
Capabilities limit the set of possible actions.
A backstory claiming inability is invalidated by demonstrated capability.

### 4. Irreversible Event Constraints

Definition:
Events that permanently change the state of the narrative and cannot be undone.

Examples:
- Death of a character
- Betrayal
- Public exposure of a secret

Why it is a constraint:
Irreversible events define hard boundaries.
Any backstory that contradicts them is immediately invalid.

### 5. Relationship Constraints

Definition:
Stable interpersonal relationships that influence behavior.

Examples:
- Loyal to X
- Hostile toward Y
- Dependent on Z

Why it is a constraint:
Relationships influence repeated decisions.
A claimed relationship incompatible with observed actions is inconsistent.

## Constraint Severity

### Hard Constraints
Violations immediately imply inconsistency.

- Irreversible event violations
- Temporal impossibilities
- Capability contradictions

### Soft Constraints
Violations accumulate evidence toward inconsistency.

- Belief mismatches
- Trait inconsistencies
- Relationship conflicts

Soft constraints are scored and aggregated rather than decided individually.

--------------------------

## Explicit Exclusions

To maintain robustness and interpretability, we explicitly do not model:

- Emotional states
- Literary themes or symbolism
- Unreliable narration
- One-off actions without repetition
- Psychological speculation

These elements are either unstable, ambiguous, or not mechanically testable.
