## Why Surface-Level LLM Reasoning Fails

Standard LLMs optimize for local plausibility.
They do not maintain a global constraint memory across long narratives.

As a result, they:
- Ignore long-range contradictions
- Confuse similarity with causality
- Fail to accumulate evidence over time

Our approach replaces plausibility with constraint consistency.
